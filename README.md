# Opencord
An open source copy of Discord hosted on GH Pages that you can use at school

## ðŸš¨ Notes:
Check security rules at `firebase.rules`

Only authentification via google is done yet

## ðŸ”¥ Known Issues: (In build but not necessarily development)

Having multiple tabs open and closing only 1 will set the user as offline

Can message users even if you've unfriended them (I was too lazy to incorporate a fix into the current build)

Display of friends in "All" tab can be optimized to make less reads to the database

"Remove Friend" and "Block" buttons in DM header are not implemented yet

User tags are generated randomly (So duplicates may occur in very rare cases)

Cannot cancel outgoing requests (Cancel button is a placeholder)

Blocked tab is not done yet
