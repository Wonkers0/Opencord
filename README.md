# Opencord
An open source copy of Discord hosted on GH Pages that you can use at school

## ðŸš¨ Notes:
Check security rules at `firebase.rules`

Only authentification via google is done yet

## ðŸ”¥ Known Issues: (In build but not necessarily development)
~~Accepting one friend request gets rid of all of them instead of only the one you accepted~~

Having multiple tabs open and closing only 1 will set the user as offline

~~Need to set height property on user card at the bottom instead of assuming 1:1 aspect ratio~~

~~Loading app fails when user first signs up (can be fixed with a refresh if you're having this problem)~~
